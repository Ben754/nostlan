# Bottlenose Setup

If you've used WiiUSBHelper select "use WiiUSBHelper template", then select your `EMULATORS` directory.  If not, select "create new template" and choose an install location.  If you don't want to move your games into the template, that's okay!  Bottlenose will prompt you for their location.
