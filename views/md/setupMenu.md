# Bottlenose Setup

Select "demo mode" to browse through sample game box art.

Select "full version" to start using Bottlenose with your own games.  Note that Bottlenose will ask you where your game libraries and emulator apps are located if it can't find them automatically.  Windows users should not put emulators in Program Files or any other folder that Bottlenose will not have read/write access to.  

Select "create new template" if you would like to organize your games using the Bottlenose file structure template.  This is optional but recommended as the easiest way to setup Bottlenose with all your emulation stuff in one place!  When you're done moving your stuff into the template choose "full version".

The bottlenose template is based of the WiiUSBHelper template.  If you've used that program choose "use WiiUSBHelper template", then select the `EMULATORS` directory, then select "full version".  For more info about the template see the [Bottlenose README](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/bottlenose/blob/master/README.md#template-file-structure).
