# Nostlan Setup

Choose a custom install location or use the default location `~/Documents/emu` for storing the game art images Nostlan will download.  Nostlan will also create a template here for you to put all your emulators and games into if you choose to.  You do not have to move them into these folders.  If no emulators or games are found in the template folders, Nostlan will prompt you for their location.
