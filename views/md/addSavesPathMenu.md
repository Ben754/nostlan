# Add Save Sync Folder

This Patreon supporter feature lets you sync game saves between your computer and a folder in the cloud or on a local storage device. Choose the location of your Dropbox, OneDrive, etc. that you want to sync your emulator game saves and save states. Play across multiple devices without losing in-game progress! More backups will take up more space.
