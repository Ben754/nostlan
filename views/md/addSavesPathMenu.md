# Add backup/sync location

This Patreon supporter feature lets you backup/sync game saves to the cloud or local storage device.  Choose the location of your Dropbox, OneDrive, etc. that you want to sync your emulator game saves and save states.  Play across multiple devices without losing in-game progress!  Your saves will be synced/backed up when you: press the "Sync Saves" button on the main menu, quit Nostlan, or open Nostlan on another device.
