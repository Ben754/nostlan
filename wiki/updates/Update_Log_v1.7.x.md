## Summary

- backup/sync all your save data to the cloud or local storage device!
- support for Yuzu Early Access builds
- custom theming (coming soon)

## New Premium Feature: Cloud Saves!

If you support Nostlan on Patreon for just $1/month you can access this new premium feature! Nostlan can automatically sync all of your emulator game saves and save states to a folder in your Dropbox, OneDrive, etc. so you can play across multiple devices without losing in-game progress! This feature has never been implemented in an emulator launcher before. I've been working on this feature for a while and I'm really excited that people will finally be able to use it!

## How to access Premium Features

On startup Nostlan will prompt you to become a Patreon supporter. Every month, Patreon supporters will be able to see a Patreon post with the monthly donor password unique to that month. Select `access premium features` from the donation menu. After you support Nostlan on Patreon, visit Nostlan's Patreon page to get the monthly donor password. Copy the password and paste it into the donor password input. Select `verify password`, if the password is correct you will have access to premium features!

## Coming Soon: Custom Theming

Custom theming is coming to Nostlan. Want to help me make the default color palettes for each system? Edit the `theme.css` files in the `themes` folder of this project and submit a pull request!

Hi my name is Quinton and this is the part where I beg you for money! Even though I decided to make this project open source and free to use, it still took a lot of work and a long time to develop. If you appreciate my work so far and will continue to use Nostlan please [donate](https://www.paypal.me/qashto/10) an amount of your choosing. If everyone that downloads this update gave me even $1 I would really appreciate it. Cloud saving is coming soon for Patreon supporters. Thank you!
