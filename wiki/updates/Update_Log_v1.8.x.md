Hi my name is Quinton and this is the part where I beg you for money! Even though I decided to make this project open source and free to use, it still took a lot of work and a long time to develop. If you appreciate my work so far and will continue to use Nostlan please [donate](https://www.paypal.me/qashto/10) an amount of your choosing. If everyone that downloads this update gave me even $1 I would really appreciate it. Cloud saving is coming soon for Patreon supporters. Thank you!
