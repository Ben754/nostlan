## A what? What's a "frontend launcher"?

A front-end or user interface (UI) is the presentation and interaction layer of an app or website. Most modern emulator apps have basic game list UIs that you can use to select games to play using a mouse/keyboard but not a game controller.

Nostlan is like the part of Netflix where you choose a movie to watch but for your game libraries. It's a fullscreen media viewer that identifies your games and downloads box art for them. You can interact with it using a mouse or game controller! Unlike [other popular front-end launchers](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/nostlan/wiki/How-is-Nostlan-different-from-other-front-ends%3F) for video game emulators, Nostlan has a sleek, minimalistic design that prioritizes box art, not a bunch of text and metadata. Check out the screenshots below!

## Features

- unified UI for mouse/gamepad interaction
- designed for UHD displays and projectors
