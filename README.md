## A what?

A front-end or user interface (UI) is the presentation and interaction layer of an app or website.  Most modern emulator apps have basic game list UIs that you can interact with using a mouse or keyboard but not a game controller.

Bottlenose looks similar to media viewers like Kaleidescape and AppleTV.  You can interact with it using a mouse or game controller.  Unlike other front-ends, Bottlenose has a minimalistic design that prioritizes box art, not metadata.  Check out the screenshots below!

## Features

-   unified UI for mouse/gamepad interaction
-   designed for _UHD_ displays and projectors
-   checks multiple database sites for the _highest quality_ box art
-   _nostalgic_ UI themes for each supported console
-   fancy scroll direction alternation effect on rows in cover view mode
-   uses individual emulators: no cores and no controller input transfer lag
-   most controllers connect to Bottlenose automatically, no setup required
-   Xbox One, PS4 Dualshock, and Switch Pro controllers all supported
-   gamecube controller adapter supported with [gca-js](https://github.com/YonicDev/gca-js)
-   advanced customization: edit launch commands and change game art

## How is Bottlenose different from other front-ends?

When I created Bottlenose I wanted to make box art the primary, practically singular, focus of the UI.  Many other frontend apps waste a lot of screen space on metadata, menus, descriptions, or just plain empty space.  This is a screenshot of Emulation Station, which is a prime example of this problem.
![](https://emulationstation.org/assets/featurettes/full/theming_list.png)

This is Launchbox for Windows, it's the most popular frontend.  Note that a lot of screen space is wasted and the game box art is thumbnail sized.
![](https://www.launchbox-app.com/Resources/Images/Screenshots/Big-Box-Nintendo-GameCube.jpg)

Windows Explorer, despite not having gamepad support, is also surprisingly popular.  I've seen reddit posts with tutorials on how to make individual executables that launch emulators with a particular game.  I think that's a pretty bad substitute for a dedicated launcher app.
![](https://i.redd.it/z7zxgap037p11.png)

Retroarch is a different kind of frontend.  It uses separate cores instead of individual emulator apps like Bottlenose does.  Game art is very low res and the interface is barebones.  It runs on a lot of platforms and seems good for small devices.
![](https://d2.alternativeto.net/dist/s/retroarch_203397_full.png?format=jpg&width=1600&height=1600&mode=min&upscale=false)

OpenEmu for macOS is a great app for making controller profiles consistent among different emulator cores.  It looks like dark mode Finder.  I use it on my Macbook on plane flights and I like it.  The covers are low-res and grid spacing is too wide though.  It doesn't support newer emulators either.

## Using Bottlenose

Bottlenose auto detects controllers when you press any button.  Controller type will be automatically determined so manual button mapping is not required.  The console themed cover overlay menu displays the basic options on any given screen.  On any game library view you can press the "Start" button on your controller or click "Bottlenose" on the overlay to access the settings menu.  "Open" will pull up a menu with a list of game consoles.  Select a console to open your game libraries for that console.  "Reset" will start the emulator without a game.  "Power" starts the emulator with the selected game.

## What is Adaptive Button Mapping?

    // Xbox/PS Adaptive profile example
    // for an Xbox One controller:

    // Nintendo: remapped to match button positions
    //  Y B  ->  X A
    // X A  ->  Y B

    // Xbox or MAME: not remapped
    //  Y B  ->  Y B
    // X A  ->  X A

    // Playstation: not remapped (similar btn positions)
    //  Y B  ->  △ ○
    // X A  ->  □ X

Although some may find this confusing at first, adaptive profiles map the button layout of your controller to match the physical button layout of controllers made for the system being emulated.  In the NTSC region, Xbox and Playstation use the bottom button of the face button diamond as the "yes" or "make selection" button.  Starting with the SNES the B button has been at the bottom of the layout diamond on Nintendo controllers.  The B button on Nintendo systems means "no" or "back".

Hence by using an "Adaptive" profile you will always be using the physically correct button layout for the system library you're browsing, regardless of what controller you use!

I recommend using adaptive mapping in your controller settings for each emulator too.  This way you can play games using the button layout that game developers intended even if you're using a controller made for a different system.

The other included gamepad mapping profile types are "Consistent", for non-adaptive remapping between controller types and "None", for no mapping, which is not recommended.  You can easily change between these options by editing your preferences file.  Set `ui.gamepad.profile` to your desired controller profile.

## System Requirements

Bottlenose will probably not perform well on low-end systems.  Ultra high resolution images require more storage and animations using these images require strong GPUs.  Although, I've tested Bottlenose on my 2016 Macbook with a 1.1GHz CPU with onboard Intel HD 515 graphics and it runs at 2304x1440 without stuttering too bad.

## Setting up Bottlenose

If you do not want to use the optional template file structure, simply select "continue" on the setup page.  Bottlenose will prompt you for the location of your game directories.  It may also prompt for the emulator app before you launch a game with Bottlenose for the first time.  Setup as you go and Bottlenose will save these locations in your preferences file.

## OPTIONAL Template File Structure

```javascript
emu (root folder can have any name)
├─┬ Dolphin
│ ├─┬ BIN
│ │ ├── User/...
│ │ ├── portable.txt
│ │ ├── Dolphin.exe
│ │ └── ...
│ └─┬ GAMES
│   ├── Super Mario Sunshine.gcz
│   ├── Super Smash Bros Melee.iso
│   └── sm64.wad
└─┬ Cemu
  ├─┬ BIN
	│ ├── Cemu.exe
  │ └── ...
  └─┬ GAMES
    └─┬ Mario Kart 8 (game folder)
      └─┬ code
        └── Turbo.rpx
```

Bottlenose was designed to OPTIONALLY use the same directory structure as WiiUSBHelper, for compatibility.  Although WiiUSBHelper is no longer maintained, Bottlenose will continue to use this structure as the template.  The default game library of each emulator will be its `GAMES` folder.  As an exception, Bottlenose will default to the internal game library of emulators that store games in file structures meant to mimic the system being emulated.  For example, RPCS3 has an internal game library that will be located at `emu/RPCS3/BIN/dev_hdd0/game`.

On windows, the auto-updater for yuzu doesn't let users pick yuzu's location.  This is okay, Bottlenose will default to the location that the installer uses instead of `emu/Yuzu/BIN`.

On macOS, Bottlenose looks for your emu apps in `Applications/`.

On Linux, Bottlenose launches most emu apps via the command line and will prompt you for the location of other emu apps.

## User Preferences

`region` game files without game IDs in their game file name, for example "Super Smash Bros Melee.iso", will be auto assigned to a default region.  Use E for North and South America, P for European PAL, J for Japan.  Currently you must rename the file of games made for other regions with the proper game ID.

`ui.mouse.wheel.smoothScroll` = false on Windows by default, should be true if you have a mouse that supports smooth scrolling (like an Apple Macbook trackpad)

`ui.mouse.wheel.multi` it's a multiplier that changes the scroll amount.

`ui.getBackCoverHQ` gets the back of the box in high quality for games without available full covers

`session.sys` the last game library viewed, Bottlenose will load this library on start-up next time the app is run

`session.{sys}.gameID` the id of the last game that was run for the specified system

`gamepad.profile` the controller profile you want to use

`{sys}.cmd.{os}` the launch command for that game system and os

## Advanced Features: Custom Launch Commands

Edit your preferences file to change the default launch command for each OS.  This is an example of Cemu's command object:

```JSON
"cmd": {
	"linux": ["wine", "${app}", "-g", "${game}", "-f"],
	"win": ["${app}", "-g", "${game}", "-f"]
}
```

## Error Reporting

Please [send me](mailto:qashto@gmail.com) a description of any errors with the relevant error log or report an issue on this project's Github.

### Mismatched or Unidentified Games

If Bottlenose has trouble matching your game file name, please take a look at the error log.  This can be easily accessed in the Bottlenose menu.  This file will tell you which game files are unidentifiable or lead to incorrect matches.  Give these files the proper game title or game ID and Bottlenose will be able to find matches in its game databases.  I know that using the file name to match the games is not ideal but it should work for most of your games.  Some other frontends read the game's header for the game id, I might implement this for certain systems in the far future.  MAME does not have this problem but Bottlenose might've still downloaded the wrong cover art.  If your game was matched in the database but the cover art is wrong email me and let me know.

### Missing Cover Art

As of version 1.0.81, Bottlenose should be able to get nearly all of your game images.  If Bottlenose can't find images for a game in the Bottlenose database you can put cover art in `emu/bottlenose/{sys}/{game.id}/img`.  For more info see the "Images" sections of this README.

## Contributing to Bottlenose

You can contribute to Bottlenose to add to and update existing game databases, make a PR or email me <mailto:qashto@gmail.com> with your new or updated entries.  Game database JSON files can be found in the db folder.  Game entries are structured like this:

```javascript
{
 "id": "G8ME01",
 "title": "Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door"
}
```

### Game Properties

-   `id` is the official id of the game
-   `name` the official name of the game, subtitles are delineated using a colon
-   `texp` the array of texture pack objects
-   `img` an object with `"imgFileName": "url"` pairs

### Texture Packs

-   `authors` usernames or real names of the author(s)
-   `name` should be short and simple, such as "UHD" or "Blue Edition"
-   `png` and `dds` link(s) to direct download the pack
-   `pngRP` and `ddsRP` link(s) to resource pack for Dolphin
-   `url` link(s) to the relevant forum post or readme
-   `version` the semantic version of the pack
-   `rate` the pack's rating 1-10
-   `patron` donation link(s) to the author(s) of pack

### Images

The following names can be used to specify images:

-   `box` the front of the box
-   `boxSide` the side of the box
-   `boxBack` the back of the box
-   `boxOpen` the inside of the game's box
-   `boxOpenMask` parts of the game's box, such as manual clips, that should appear above the game media, manual, and memory card
-   `cart` the front of the game's (first) cartridge
-   `coverFull` the entire cover sleeve, no box
-   `cover` the front facing portion of the cover sleeve, no box
-   `coverSide` the side facing portion of the cover sleeve, no box
-   `coverBack` the side facing portion of the cover sleeve, no box
-   `disc` the front of the game's (first) disc
-   `manual` the front of the game's manual
-   `memory` the front of a memory card
-   `memoryBack` the back of a memory card
-   `promo` a promotional insert included in the game box

Front cover box art is prioritized in this order: box (highest quality), coverFull, cover, box (low quality).  In a future version of Bottlenose users will be able to add image urls from within the UI.  For now, you can add them in the game's `img` object like this:

```javascript
{
  "id": "ALERA",
  "title": "Mario Tennis Aces",
  "img": {
    "box": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91TvX36nF-L.jpg"
  }
}
```

## Development Info

Bottlenose is open source!  I loved using Electron to make Bottlenose.  I highly recommend it to developers interested in creating native desktop apps with node.js.  Bottlenose is written in Javascript, Pug, HTML and CSS.  It uses jQuery, Bootstrap, and Contro.

## Contributing to Bottlenose (code)

PRs are welcome!  No callback pyramids, use Async/Await whenever possible.  Do not write plain JS novels when editing the DOM, just use jQuery please.  Email me if you want to collaborate on this project!

## Credits

Obviously, Bottlenose wouldn't exist without the developers of these emulators.  Please support the development of emulators you use!
